Console game to develop my OOP skills. UI is not that pretty but it doesn't matter. Game is still in development and I have no idea when will I finish this.

# Running game
After entering game directory type following commands  
`mkdir build`  
`cd build/`  
`cmake ../`  
`make`   
`./SpaceTradeSimulator`
